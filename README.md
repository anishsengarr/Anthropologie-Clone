                                      Project Anthropologie Clone

This is my first project at Masai School using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I worked on Anthropologie.com, an online Ecommerce Site.

I have a time frame of seven days. This was the first website building project for me, yes I'm emphasizing "website building" because I have built this website from scratch.

I tried to give our website some common functionality such as Carousel Sliding, Tab Switching, Dropdown Menu, Hover Effects, On-scroll shrinking, Store/Brand pages, product pages, Cart pages, Payment pages, and the most important Search filtering.

I have tried to build the exact Navigation bar as original site has with the On-scroll size shrinking and the drop-down menu on-hover, and many other functions. I have built the exact footer as it is on the original website.
